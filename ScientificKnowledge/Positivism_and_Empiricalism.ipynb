    "# Empiricism\n",
    "Knowledge comes primarily from experience and observation of the world.\n",
    "```\n",
    "We know things because we observe them, not because they \"feel true\" & not because authority says so\n",

    "```\n",
    "What does the data say?\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Example \n",
    "We observe temperature, pressure, wind and we build models to predict rain. Even though we can't see future rain, empiricism allows theoretical models based on observed data."

    "### Core elements\n",
    "1. Observation first : Knowledge begins with Seeing, Measuring & Recording.\n",
    "2. Experience over speculation : Empiricism distrusts pure imagination & untestable theories & hypothesis.\n",
    "3. Inductive reasoning : Empiricism uses induction Observe many cases & Infer general patterns (observation -> scientific method -> theory/conclusion).\n",
    "4. Knowledge is probabilistic : Empirical knowledge is never 100% certain & always subject to revision.\n",

    "### Tabula Rasa\n",
    "John Locke introduced the idea of Tabula Rasa, which means \"blank slate\"\n",
    "He believed that humans are born knowing nothing. At birth, the mind is empty, and all knowledge comes from experience and the senses.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In contrast, Plato's essentialism argues that humans are born with built-in knowledge. Ideas such as right and wrong are already inside us, coded by nature or God, and learning is simply remembering what is already there.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Aristotle believed that universal knowledge comes from observing particular experiences, not from inborn ideas."
