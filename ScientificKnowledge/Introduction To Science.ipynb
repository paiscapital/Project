    "#### 2. Hypothesis\n",
    "You propose a structured explanation. Example \"Momentum predicts short-term returns\" or \"Negative sentiment leads to price drops” and A hypothesis must be testable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Experiment / Test\n",
    "You test the hypothesis under controlled conditions. Example backtesting a trading strategy, training a model on historical data & cross-validation.  \n",

    "#### 4. Measurement & Error\n",
    "Science cares more about how wrong you are than how right. Key ideas:\n",

    "1. Descriptive : Describes what happens (Prices are more volatile during news events).\n",
    "2. Explanatory : Explains why it happens (Information shocks increase uncertainty).\n",
    "3. Predictive : Predicts future outcomes (High volatility today → higher probability of volatility tomorrow). Prediction is the strongest test.\n",
    "4. Applied : Used to change or control outcomes (Risk management, AI-driven trading & Engineering systems)."
