    "#### Critical realism \n",
    "Reality exists independently of us, but we can never know it perfectly. Science improves understanding by testing, correcting & retesting. All measurements may contain error & all theories may be wrong. Thats why post positivism :\n",

    "#### Triangulation\n",
    "Because no single method is perfect so post-positivism uses triangulation. Triangulation is using multiple ways to study the same phenomenon. Four types : \n",
    "1. Method triangulation : Quantitative + Qualitative\n",
    "2. Data sources triangulation : Different people, times & settings\n",
    "3. Analysis triangulation : Different analysts or model\n",

    "#### Theory-Laden observation\n",
    "Post-positivism argue that observations are never truly neutral (without any influenced ). What we see, notice, or measure is influenced by our background, culture, experience and beliefs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Post-positivism is not like relativism (Everything is subjective), There is reality/truth & people can reach the same understanding but it never 100% perfect. Bias cant be eliminated, but can be reduced using multiple methods (qualitative, quantitative), transparent assumption & peer review.\n",
