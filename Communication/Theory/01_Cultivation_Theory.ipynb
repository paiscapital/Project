    "#### 1. Cumulative (Builds Over Time)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultivation does not work like persuasion, It works like weathering.\n",
    "```\n",
    "One rain doesn’t erode a rock.\n",
    "Thousands of rains do.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Media exposure:\n",
    "- Day 1 → no effect\n",
    "- Day 30 → subtle expectations\n",
    "- Day 365 → worldview shift\n",
    "\n",
    "No single video causes cultivation, but Frequency + consistency does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroscience:\n",
    "- Repeated exposure strengthens neural pathways\n",
    "- Rare information decays\n",
    "- Common patterns become “normal”\n",
    "\n",
    "Reality is concluted from repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Subconscious (Below Awareness)\n",
    "\n",
    "People often say “I know this is just media”, but Cultivation still works because:\n",
    "- The brain tracks statistical patterns automatically\n",
    "- Conscious skepticism doesn’t stop pattern learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Example, you know crime news is exaggerated, but you still feel the world is unsafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroscience:\n",
    "- The amygdala reacts to frequency, not logic\n",
    "- The brain evolved to detect danger patterns fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultivation bypasses critical thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Pattern-Based, Not Message-Based\n",
    "Media effects are NOT about one headline, argument, ideology but they are about distribution patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The brain asks unconsciously:\n",
    "1. Who appears most often?\n",
    "2. Who wins?\n",
    "3. Who gets punished?\n",
    "4. Who is invisible?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example, If media repeatedly shows criminals = poor, heroes = rich, leaders = men its created a streotypes.\n",
    "Even without saying it explicitly, the brain learns the pattern.\n",

    "#### 4 Core Patterns Media Repeats\n",
    "patterns are what your brain absorbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Who Has Power:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Who speaks?\n",
    "Who decides?\n",
    "Who wins conflicts?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Repeated portrayal → power feels \"natural\".\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Who Is Dangerous:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Who commits violence?\n",
    "Who is framed as threat?\n",
    "Who causes chaos?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Repeated portrayal → fear attaches to groups or ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Who Matters:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Who gets screen time?\n",
    "Whose suffering is shown?\n",
    "Whose success is celebrated?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Visibility = value.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) What Success Looks Like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wealth?\n",
    "Fame?\n",
    "Luxury?\n",
    "Control?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Repeated portrayal → aspiration formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Neuroscience\n",
    "The brain does NOT remember facts, statistics, corrections but The brain remembers frequency, visibility, emotional salience.\n",
