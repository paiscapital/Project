    "# Cultural Imperialism Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "When a powerful country or group spreads its culture so widely that other cultures slowly copy it, depend on it or replace their own traditions with it. This usually happens without force, through media, technology, education, and lifestyle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cultural Imperialism = powerful cultures shaping how others think, live, and see the world.\n"

    "#### Step By Step\n",
    "1. Media Dominance : Powerful countries control movies, TV shows, music, news agencies & social media platforms.    \n",
    "2. Repetition & normalisation : People everywhere see the same values repeatedly such as individualism, consumerism, beauty standards, success = money/fame. Over time, these feel \"normal\".    \n",
    "3. Local culture : Local traditions start to feel old-fashioned, less attractive & less \"modern\". People may prefer western fashion, language & lifestyle.    \n",
    "4. Mental dependence : People begin to measure success using foreign standards, look to foreign media for validation & doubt their own cultural identity. This is the most powerful stage for control of the mind.\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Example :\n",
    "```\n",
    "English becomes dominant, local languages used less in business, science, and pop culture. The result is Knowledge and power flow in one direction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Spread Easily \n",
    "Because it comes packaged as entertainment, convenience, modernity & freedom of choice, but choice is not equal when one culture has massive global reach & others struggle to compete"
