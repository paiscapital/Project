    "MPT refer to a situation in which a group, behavior, idea and phenomenon is potrayed by the media as a threat to societal values, norms, public safety even though the actual threat is often exaggerated to reality. or when society becomes extremely afraid of something that is exaggerated or misunderstood, and that fear spreads faster than facts.\n",

    "→ Authority reaction\n",
    "→ Long-lasting damage\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "1. One student brings a knife\n",

    "#### Core Elements\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Created -> A group or thing becomes the villain (Teenagers, Immigrants, Video games, Music genres, Social media, New technology) They are blamed for “moral decline.”   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Media blow up -> Fear sells attention : Selects extreme cases, Repeats emotional language, Removes context using word  (crisis, threat, out of control, destroying our values)  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Public fear spreads socially -> Share stories emotionally, Don’t verify facts, Feel “something must be done”  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Authorities respond strongly -> Politicians, schools, police react by: Creating new laws, Increasing surveillance, Banning things  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The panic fades—but damage remains -> Rights restricted, Groups stigmatized, Policies stay  \n",
