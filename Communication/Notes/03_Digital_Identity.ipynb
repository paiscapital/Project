    "#### Types of Digital Identity\n",
    "1. Centralized identity:\n",
    "    - a digital identity model in which one central authority or organization controls the storage, verification, and management of user identities.\n",
    "    - Managed by a single organization (e.g., Google, Facebook, government portals).\n",
    "    - Users depend on the provider to store and secure their data.\n",
    "    - User â†’ Identity Provider (IDP/verify username,password,keys) â†’ Service Provider (SP/service App google)\n",
    "    - E.g: Login to google (ISP) to using YT (SP)\n",
    "2. Federated Identity:\n",
    "    - Allow users to use one identity across multiple platforms (OAuth/SAML)\n",
    "    - E.g: Register in Academic platform using google (OAuth)\n",
    "3. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):\n",
    "    - A decentralized model using blockchain or cryptography, giving full control to the user.\n",
    "    - User stores and shares only selected credentials."
