    "#### Why It Happen\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Information Overload:\n",
    "    - Too much information everywhere (news,posts,memes,videos,opinions) no one can check it all& hard to know what’s real.\n",
    "    - This make our brains say \"This feels right, i will believe this\"\n",
    "    - Feel tired of checking facts& Start trusting what fits their gut feeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Emotional Politics:\n",
    "    - Modern media and politics don’t try to convince people with logic anymore.\n",
    "    - Loss of trust → people doubt governments, media, scientists.\n",
    "    - They use emotion (fear, anger, pride, or identity) because emotion spreads faster and grabs attention.\n",
    "    - \"Theyre stealing your freedom!\" feels more powerful than \"Policy X will reduce GDP by  2.4%\"\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mindset | Meaning | Example |\n",
    "|---------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| Is it true (Epistemic) | You check the facts& sources | Reading scientific reports |\n",
    "| Does it feel true (Affective) | You believe what fits your emotions or worldview. | Sharing a meme that “feels right.” |\n",

    "#### Psychology Side\n",
    "1. Emotional over Rational Processing:\n",
    "    - When people see information that fits their beliefs or values, it triggers emotional satisfaction, a feeling of safety or belonging.\n",
    "    - The brain releases dopamine when something “feels right,” so emotions become a shortcut for deciding what’s true (Resonance)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cognitive Biases:\n",
    "    - Confirmation bias: We seek information that supports what we already believe.\n",
    "    - Availability bias: We believe what’s easiest to remember or most repeated.\n",
    "    - Affective reasoning: We judge ideas based on how they make us feel, not on evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Social Identity& Belonging:\n",
    "    - When a belief becomes part of group identity, disagreeing feels like betrayal.\n",
    "    - People defend ideas that match their tribe’s emotions, not necessarily the truth.\n"
